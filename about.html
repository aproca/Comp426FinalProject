    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <br>
    <p>ViBE was created by four UNC Chapel Hill Students</p>
    <img src=uncchapelhill.png alt="CODING" class="image">
    <br>
    <p>On a stormy November night, four laptop screens shined brighter then the rest. While the rest of the UNC student <body>
        was concering themselves with dreams of Thanksgiving break, these brave four students thought of a local music web application
        that would be the best program to ever be programmed by a team of programmers. The idea itself was come up with Everett, who after looking down
        at his lap in despair, lifted his eyes and uttered one word "Eureka."

    <h2>Our Team</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Four of the top minds in tech.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <img src=amazing.png alt="fine" class="image2">
    <br>
    <p>Simply put, to be the best, to ace the competition. We provide
    top of the line programs, the best staistics you will ever see, all to power
    the most powerful music program to ever be programed by programers. Stay calm,
    what you are witnessing is the future of technology, instantly joining every local
    artist with a band name like "Grandpa Dad Club Mom" into one cohesive space
    that defies the normative boundaries set in place by the constantly metastasizing online 
    space. Philosphers Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari talked about the rhizome in their massively
    influential post-modern work "A Thousand Plateus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia." Exactly like
    this idea in their masterwork of modern philosophical thought, we have decentrilized music, moved it from a world of 
    unfortinute binaries into a constantly colliding plane of consistency. A body without
    organs.
